Watson Conversation, when used with this plugin, allows you to build and deploy
a fully customized chat bot with little technical knowledge. It can talk to your
website's visitors about whatever you choose, from helping navigate the website
and providing support with common questions, to just having a casual
conversation on a topic of interest.

Nope. This plugin allows you to easily deploy chatbots that you create using the
Watson Conversation service on IBM Bluemix. [These
instructions](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/doc/conversation/getting-started.html)
